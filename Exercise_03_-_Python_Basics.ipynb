    "#### Three is a Crowd\n",
    "- Make a list of names that includes at least four people.\n",
    "- Write an if test that prints a message about the room being crowded, if there are more than three people in your list.\n",
    "- Modify your list so that there are only two people in it. Use one of the methods for removing people from the list, don't just redefine the list.\n",
    "- Run your if test again. There should be no output this time, because there are less than three people in the list.\n",
    "- **Bonus:** Store your if test in a function called something like `crowd_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Three is a Crowd - Part 2\n",
    "- Save your program from *Three is a Crowd* under a new name.\n",
    "- Add an `else` statement to your if tests. If the `else` statement is run, have it print a message that the room is not very crowded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Six is a Mob\n",
    "- Save your program from *Three is a Crowd - Part 2* under a new name.\n",
    "- Add some names to your list, so that there are at least six people in the list.\n",
    "- Modify your tests so that\n",
    "    - If there are more than 5 people, a message is printed about there being a mob in the room.\n",
    "    - If there are 3-5 people, a message is printed about the room being crowded.\n",
    "    - If there are 1 or 2 people, a message is printed about the room not being crowded.\n",
    "    - If there are no people in the room, a message is printed abou the room being empty."
